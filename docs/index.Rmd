This GitHub Pages website provides the rendered HTML-Reports comprising
the figures and results of Tretow et al. 2023 published in XXX. The
HTML-Reports are split into 8 analysis sections and can be accessed via
the links below:

# Quality assessment

[Quality_assessment.html](../1_Quality_assessment/Quality_assessment.html)
includes the quality assessment of the knockdown and overexpression
experiments, including verification of *HNRNPH1*, *HNRNPH2*, *ACTB* and
*GAPDH* expression levels, PCAs of the knockdown and overexpression
experiments and the correlation of *HNRNPH1* expression levels and
HNRNPH protein concentrations.

# MAJIQ alternative splicing analysis

[MAJIQ_AS_analysis.html](../2_MAJIQ_AS_analysis/MAJIQ_AS_analysis.html)
provides information about the post-processing of the MAJIQ modulizer
output, the detection of regulated AS events and the filtering of the
final sets regulated and non-regulated AS events.

# Dose-response curve fitting

[Dose_response_curve_fitting.html](../3_Dose_response_curve_fitting/Dose_response_curve_fitting.html)
includes the description of the fitting process, the filtering of
high-quality fittings, the validation of selected events by qRT-PCR and
the generation of browser shots for cassette exon events in *MYL6* and
*PIP4K2C*.

# iCLIP analysis

[Genomic_location_of_binding_sites.html](../4_iCLIP_analysis/Genomic_location_of_binding_sites.html)
provides information about the genomic distribution of HNRNPH binding
sites, meaning the overlap with genes of different biotypes, features of
protein-coding genes and genes with regulated AS events.

[Sequence_composition_of_binding_sites.html](../4_iCLIP_analysis/Sequence_composition_of_binding_sites.html)
includes the generation of a logoplot based on all binding sites as well as
the comparative tetramer analysis between strong and weak binding sites as 
well as between binding sites located in cooperatively regulated cassette
exon events and control (non-regulated) cassette exon events.

[RNAmaps_of_regulated_events.html](../4_iCLIP_analysis/RNAmaps_of_regulated_events.html)
provides information about the generation of HNRNPH RNA splicing maps on
cooperatively regulated cassette exon events, including the selection of
control cassette exon events, normalization and statistical analysis.

# RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) analysis
[Dependence_of_binding_and_cooperativity_on_rG4s.html](../5_rG4_analysis/Dependence_of_binding_and_cooperativity_on_rG4s.html)

# TCGA analysis
[Correlation_HNRNPH_levels_and_splicing_events.html](../8_TCGA_analysis/Correlation_HNRNPH_levels_and_splicing_events.html) 

[Clustering_BRCA_samples.html](../8_TCGA_analysis/Clustering_BRCA_samples.html)
